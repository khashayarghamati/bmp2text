INSTALL
-------

bmp2txt was tested under the following platform:
- i386: Linux 2.4.20 (Debian 3.0)

bmp2txt should compile on every ANSI C compiler. If not then write to me at
tom@eggdrop.ch

Just type 'make' to compile, 'make install' as root to install it and
'make clean' to clean unnecessary binaries.

Read README before using this program.

To remove bmp2txt type as root 'make uninstall'.
